## About This Project
This project was created and prvided as solution to the engineering test in MileApp.

## Quick Start Guide
- First, you need to clone this repository using https 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yanuz93/laravel-simple-api.git
    ```

    or you can use GitHub CLI
    ```
    gh repo clone yanuz93/laravel-simple-api
    ```

- Next, you need to install all dependencies using PHP Composer. If you haven't installed it before, please read and follow the instruction given in their [official page](https://getcomposer.org). Then, install the dependencies using the command below
    ```
    composer install
    ```

- Setup your apps environment and testing environment in .env and .env.testing respectively.
    1. Copy the entire environment from .env.example file
        ```
        cp .env.example .env .env.testing
        ```
    2. Change the environment variables below to match your local and testing database configuration.
        ```
        DB_CONNECTION=mongodb
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=27017
        DB_DATABASE=
        DB_USERNAME=
        DB_PASSWORD=
        ```

- Run your application with [Nginx](https://nginx.com), [Apache](https://apache.org), or any other web server and even using [PHP](https:/php.net) default server using this command.
    ```
    php -S {hostname}:{port} server.php
    ```

- Now, you can access the API in `http://{hostname}:{port}/api`
